# ðŸ“¸ How to Add Your Viego Profile Picture

## Quick Steps:

1. **Find your AI Viego portrait image file**
   - Make sure it's named `profile.jpg` (or rename it)
   - Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`

2. **Replace the placeholder:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the lol-cv folder
   cd "lol-cv/public"
   
   # Replace the placeholder with your image
   # Simply drag and drop your Viego image here and name it "profile.jpg"
   ```

3. **Or using command line:**
   ```bash
   # If your image is on Desktop (for example)
   cp ~/Desktop/viego-portrait.jpg "lol-cv/public/profile.jpg"
   ```

4. **Refresh your browser** - The image will appear in the hexagonal champion portrait!

## ðŸŽ¨ Image Recommendations:

- **Best size:** 500x500px to 1000x1000px
- **Aspect ratio:** Square (1:1) works best
- **File size:** Under 500KB for fast loading
- **Focus:** Make sure your face is centered (it will be clipped in a hexagon)

## âœ… The image will appear:
- In the **Champion Select** screen
- Inside the **hexagonal golden border**
- With a slight blue/gold overlay for that LoL effect
